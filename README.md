## Jade
JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) is a software Framework fully implemented in the Java language. It simplifies the implementation of multi-agent systems.

## Multi-agent Systems
A multi-agent system (M.A.S.) is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents within an environment. Multi-agent systems can be used to solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent or a monolithic system to solve. Intelligence may include some methodic, functional, procedural approach, algorithmic search or reinforcement learning.

## Coloring Graph
The idea of the problem is how to color the nodes of a graph so that all peer nodes are connected by an edge of a different color. The difficulty of this problem lies in optimizing the chromatic number (coloring with the smallest number of colors possible). For this project, I created a SMA composed of three agents who will work (and communicate) to color the graph a bit lower using three colors. The agents will have a partial view of the graph and can not by themselves find a valid solution without working together.
